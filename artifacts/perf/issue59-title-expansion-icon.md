## Scenario Model

| Scenario | Kind | User flow | Measurement scope | Input model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| tree-expansion-toggle-visible-tree | user-flow | Expand and then collapse the visible tree. | Expansion commands, workspace-state mutation, and visible-tree rebuild/render. | Fixture workspace tree in a VS Code event harness. |

## Metric Model

| Table | Value model | Accuracy model |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Latency | Wall-clock elapsed time around each harness flow iteration, summarized as min/p50/p90/p95/max. | Exact for each sampled iteration in this run. |
| Profiled RSS Burst | Difference between the isolated scenario worker RSS measured immediately before the flow and that worker iteration's OS high-water-mark peak RSS. | Exact for the measured worker iteration, using `process.memoryUsage().rss` at flow start and `process.resourceUsage().maxRSS` for the peak. |
| Profiled Peak RSS | Highest process RSS reached by each isolated scenario worker iteration. | Exact worker-process high-water mark from `process.resourceUsage().maxRSS`. |
